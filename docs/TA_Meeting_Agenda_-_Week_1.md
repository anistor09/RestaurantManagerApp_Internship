# TA Meeting Agenda - Group 6C

### Week: 1
### Main focus: Project plan

## **Opening**
- Check in, how is everyone doing
- Understand what documents are expected

## **Main topics**
## 1. Project overview
- What kind of support can we expect from the TA?
- How strict are we evaluated process-wise?

## 2. Code of Conduct
- How elaborate should the code of conduct be? Can we skip sections that are not of interest with our team?

## 3. Project plan
- We have a more delicate situation since we are working on top of an ongoing project and not start a new one from scratch. Thus, the frameworks should match the existent codebase, we can't make decisions about this. Is this okay?
- Can we receive feedback on this project plan?
- Do you recommend using Scrum as development methodology? If so, should the Sprint retrospectives be documented in Gitlab or just discussing the progress in the TA meetings is enough?


## **Closure and Summary**
- Go through the established arrangements one more time
- Decide on scheduling next meeting
