# Meeting Notes

1. Progress Update

Our clients are pleased with our progress. Design suggestions:


Menus page
> if there are no subcategories, display the items directly, without expansion and without naming it "Others" (hide the expansion button)

> select a first menu instead of showing instructions

> button needs to be "Remove from menu" instead of "Delete"

> could have: use order of the menu to display the elements

> if there are no items in "Others" just delete it

Edit Item View
> instead of having the "Other" subcategory if there are no subcategories, make it disabled

Products
> make sure that, when saving, the products page is automatically reloaded

> on mobile view, have only one column for the cards

> make the store persistent (see links on chat)

Tables
> add a loading bar/change the cursor into a loading bar

> rename "Select" to something more specific

Help
> remove the Help page 

Settings
> move the working hours to the right part of the page

> for working hours, add whether the restaurant is open or closed and disable if closed

2. Sprint Planning

> Sprint 3: finish Must this week + improve design based on suggestions + testing (end of wk6)

> Sprint 4: Should requirements, try to do them all in one week

3. Requirements

> the currency should just change the displayed symbol and not do any type of conversions
