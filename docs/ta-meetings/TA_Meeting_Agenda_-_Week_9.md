# Meeting notes

- user test: find a form on Google, send it to some people and discuss what features they liked and what they didn't
- try to incorporate TW feedback when possible, but keep information related to client problems
- aim for at least 80% + e2e and integration
- we can have a lot less than 12000 words (e.g. 8000), references are only relevant for TW
- break the requirements, doesn't matter if the distribution is not equal
- be very specific
