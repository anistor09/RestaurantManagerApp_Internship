# Meeting Notes
- If the backend is not ready this week, we need to talk with the clients for finding solution (mock server or rethink about the requirements) 
- Itâ€™s already wk 5, so we need to start making tests.
- Talk with the coach for the backend situation.
- Add all issues in the sprint planning. (Nu pe masura ce lucram)
- Split the issue with weight 13( 13 -> 25h+). Difficulty does not mean importance. Check the link from the TA.
- For the next spring apply the advice regarding the weight
- Issues and MR are perfect, nothing to improve.
- Book a place for the presentation.
- For presentation: present the framework, the requirements and a demo. Mention also about the planning/process (SCRAM). A summary of project plan is good for the mid-term (max 20 min). A Q&A is after the presentation. We need to make some slides for the presentation
- The application needs to be deployed and available. 
- In conclusion, untill now, we are on time.
