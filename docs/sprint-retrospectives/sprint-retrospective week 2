### What did we do well? (positive events)
- We made quite good progress in terms of our application design and functionality
- Our aim was to connect our app with the database in order to persist changes
- CRUD operations for tables are finished (apart from tests and documentation)
- Rest of the must requirements are almost finished (menus, products, category and edit/add item)

 ### Next sprint
- We should have a complete design and all CRUD functionality ready (i.e. the must requirements)
- We will finish the authentication
- We will start testing and documenting features

### What should we improve? (negative events)
- Authentication took longer than expected and could not finish it in time, so it needed to be prolonged to sprint 3; it had a time estimate of 8h, but proved to be more difficult than we thought, making the time estimate closer to 20h
- Edit/add item page wiring and some other pages were not finished due to incomplete backend endpoint 
- Choices and options visualization was delayed due to unexpected bugs related to Nuxt3
