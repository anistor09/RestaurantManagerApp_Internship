### What did we do well? (positive events)
- We made quite good progress in terms of our application design
- Our aim was to create the components needed for our application, as well as the login page
- Most of the components for the must have requirements are ready, EXCEPT for:
 > add/edit cateogry/subcategory page
 > side dishes, options and choices in the edit item page
 > add menu page (pop-up)

 ### Next sprint
- We will focus on wiring these components to create reactive **pages** and building the interaction with the database
- We should have a complete design and most CRUD functionality ready (i.e. the must requirements)
- We will start the authentication

### What should we improve? (negative events)
- Our requirements are too vague, which made our process more chaotic than expected
- We need to internally expand our requirements to have a more clear overview of what needs to be done
- We need to plan our issues better to make sure everyone is assigned equal weight
