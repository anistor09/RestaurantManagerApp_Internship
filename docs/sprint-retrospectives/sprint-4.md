- For the backend, we were blocked untill Thursday for some client's endpoint.
- Radu's issue will be continued also this week because he need to implemenent the addition of the photos in more pages.
- The client's server maximum no. of charachers for descrpitions was 255. This was a problem because the AI description generates more than 255 and it tooks a lot to debug this.
