### What did we do well? (positive events)
- We made quite good progress in terms of our application design and functionality
- Our aim was to finish the must haves (including the test for the functionality)
- Our application is tested (almost completely) with unit and integration tests

 ### Next sprint
- Our target is to finish the should haves (analytics and AI)
- For the analitycs we will start to do some backend, which will be on the other repository (EWAI group Backend)
- We will finish testing and documenting features

### What should we improve? (negative events)
- Making the configuration for the tests took longer than everyone expected and this kept us blocked for a few days. That is why our sprint was delayed with 3 days.
- Some of the endpoints still do not work. The clients promised that untill 4th June the endpoints will work. We are waiting for the fix.
