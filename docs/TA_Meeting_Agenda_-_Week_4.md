# Meeting Notes
## 1. Individual progress
 - our TA seems pleased with the progress we did so far

## 2. Next assignment due
 - not a lot of ethical issues for our project, we can only pick one
 - design -> reason about our design in Figma + architecture of the project (backend/frontend, 2 separate repositories)

## 3. Feedback for our first sprint
 - the Gitlab usage is good so far, especially the reviews
 - boards are not required since we are using milestones
 - we are on track, keep up with the sprints
 - write a readme after must-have (!important)
 - start with tests from next sprint 2 onwards
 - also try UI **testing**, it's a nice bonus (and can boost our grade)
 - write a **documentation**, do this once a feature is done (implement -> test -> document)
 - write a Sprint Retrospective and reflect on how the process went (!important, to be done until next meeting)

## 4. Planning
 - next meeting: Monday, 12:15
 - next deadlines: Design (Tuesday), Buddycheck (Sunday) 
 - midterm presentation: how the process went, how much is left, how are we in terms of requirements

## 5. Client gitlab access
